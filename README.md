# Crop Recommendation System

## Project Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based application designed to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crops based on soil conditions, weather, and environmental factors. By analyzing parameters like soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, the system predicts the optimal crop for cultivation, helping to increase yield and reduce losses.

## Features
- Analyzes soil and environmental data to recommend crops.
- Uses machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- Provides a simple workflow from data processing to model deployment.
- Saves trained models for future predictions.

## Dataset
The system uses a dataset containing soil and climate information for different crops. Example features include:
- Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall
- Soil pH
- Crop label (target variable)
