# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System using AI/ML

## 📌 Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a Machine Learning project that suggests the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions.  
By analyzing **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall**, the system provides **data-driven crop recommendations** that can help farmers improve yield and ensure sustainable farming practices.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of crop dataset  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Machine Learning model training & evaluation (Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.)  
- Model deployment for real-time predictions  
- Final report and documentation
