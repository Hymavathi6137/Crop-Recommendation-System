Crop Recommendation System - Week 1 Project Plan

Objective:
- Prepare the crop dataset for machine learning.
- Understand the dataset features and target variable.
- Clean the data for further model training.

Tasks:

1. Data Collection:
   - Collect the crop dataset (crop_recommendation.csv).
   - Ensure the dataset contains features like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil pH, and crop label.

2. Data Exploration:
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand:
     - Number of rows and columns
     - Data types of features
     - Statistical summary (mean, min, max, std)
     - Distribution of target variable

3. Data Cleaning:
   - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
   - Remove or correct any inconsistent data if present.
   - Save the cleaned dataset as `crop_cleaned.csv` for Week 2.

4. Documentation:
   - Document all observations and cleaning steps in the notebook (`Week1_Data_Preparation.ipynb`).
   - Maintain a project plan detailing the tasks completed and next steps.

Next Steps (Week 2):
- Use the cleaned dataset to train machine learning models.
- Evaluate different models and select the best performing one.
