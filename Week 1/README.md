# Crop Recommendation System - Week 1

## Week 1 Overview
In Week 1, the focus was on **data collection, exploration, and preparation**. This forms the foundation for building the machine learning models in the upcoming weeks.

---

## Goals
- Collect the crop dataset (`crop_recommendation.csv`)
- Explore the dataset to understand features and target variable
- Clean the dataset and handle missing values if any
- Prepare the dataset for model training

---

## Dataset
- File: `data/crop_recommendation.csv`
- Contains features such as:
  - Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
  - Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall
  - Soil pH
  - Target: Crop label

---

## Notebooks
- `notebooks/Week1_Data_Preparation.ipynb`  
  Tasks performed:
  - Loaded the dataset using Pandas
  - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Checked for missing or inconsistent data
  - Saved cleaned dataset as `crop_cleaned.csv` for Week 2

---

## Project Plan
- File: `project_plan.txt`
- Contains the step-by-step plan for Week 1 tasks and next steps

---

## Next Steps
- Use the cleaned dataset in **Week 2** for training machine learning models
