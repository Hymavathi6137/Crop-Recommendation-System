# Week 3 - Deployment Phase

## Contents
- **notebooks/Week3_Deployment.ipynb** → Deployment notebook for testing predictions  
- **trained_model/crop_model.pkl** → Saved machine learning model  
- **final_report.md** → Final report summarizing the entire project  

## Objectives
- Deploy the trained crop recommendation model  
- Test predictions with real input values  
- Prepare the final project report  

## Sample Prediction
Input: N=90, P=42, K=43, Temperature=25°C, Humidity=80%, pH=6.5, Rainfall=200mm  
Output: **✅ Recommended Crop → Maize**
