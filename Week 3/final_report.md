# Final Report - Crop Recommendation System

## Project Title
Crop Recommendation System using AI/ML

## Domain
Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Farmers often struggle to decide the most suitable crop for cultivation due to varying soil nutrients, rainfall, and climate conditions. Traditional methods rely on guesswork, which may result in poor yields and economic loss.

## Solution
An AI/ML-based system that recommends the best crop based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH value, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.  
The trained ML model predicts the most suitable crop with high accuracy, replacing guesswork with data-driven decisions.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection (Crop dataset in CSV format)  
2. Data Preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values)  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations, correlation checks)  
4. Model Training (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes)  
5. Model Evaluation (accuracy, classification report)  
6. Deployment (saving model as `crop_model.pkl` and testing predictions)

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- GitHub (Version Control)  

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting crops  
- Provided clear recommendations based on soil and environmental factors  
- Output screenshots/diagrams demonstrate predictions (e.g., Rice, Wheat, Maize)

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates how AI/ML can assist farmers in crop selection, improving productivity and ensuring sustainable farming.  

## Future Scope
- Deploy as a web/mobile app for farmers  
- Integration with IoT sensors for real-time soil monitoring  
- Use real-time weather API for dynamic predictions
