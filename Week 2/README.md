# Crop Recommendation System - Week 2

## Week 2 Overview
In Week 2, the focus is on **training machine learning models** using the cleaned dataset from Week 1.

---

## Goals
- Load the cleaned dataset (`crop_cleaned.csv`)
- Train machine learning models (Random Forest)
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification report
- Save the trained model (`crop_model.pkl`) for deployment

---

## Notebooks
- `notebooks/Week2_Model_Training.ipynb`:
  - Load and explore cleaned data
  - Encode target labels
  - Train and evaluate Random Forest model
  - Save trained model for Week 3 deployment

---

## Next Steps
- Use the trained model in **Week 3** for deployment and testing
